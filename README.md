# OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE project

This is the OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE project repository done for the Robot Programming course at Sapienza University of Rome. The goal of the project is to build a node
that computes a repulsive field from the local laser scans and modulates the /cmd_vel so that the robot does not clash with the wall if instructed to do so.
